# Video preprocessing web-ui

**Main Readme is inside backend project**

Implementation notes
1. React-query was used for state management for simplicity
2. Forms (Sign up/sign in/...) can be separated to common components, but I didn't have time for this
3. Remove silence should have margin params


# Run
*To run whole project refer to backend's README.md* 

`bash ./run-dev.sh`
